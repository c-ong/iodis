All these Redis commands need a helper string, each, wouldn't that be quite
useful? I was thinking of pairs of commandName and commandDocString and then
when we do newSlot, we could do some more there. Munging
http://code.google.com/p/redis/wiki/CommandReference could be one way of
getting docstrings. Using xpath $x("//td[@id='wikimaincol']//li") gets one
quite far.
